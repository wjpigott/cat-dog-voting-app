# Workflows Disabled

All workflow files have been intentionally removed to prevent automatic execution.

This directory intentionally contains only this README file to force GitHub 
to recognize that no workflows should run.

To re-enable workflows:
1. Restore workflow files from archive/outdated-workflows/
2. Update triggers to be manual-only (workflow_dispatch)
3. Test manually before enabling automatic triggers
